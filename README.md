# IPA â€“ Integrated Portable Assistant

**IPA** is an AI system designed for integration into the upcoming **Portable Scientific Device (PSD)** â€” a fully customizable toolkit for students, engineers, and researchers. While IPA currently runs online, future versions of the PSD will feature it as a **locally installed AI assistant**, operating on a Raspberry Pi with a Linux-based system.
